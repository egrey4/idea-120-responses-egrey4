<h1> Non-linear Narrative Concept </h1> 

<p1> The overall idea for my non-linear narrative involves a rat (main character) and it's journey finding food. I'd like to name the game "Fat Rat" and it will go through it's journey collecting food - specifically cheese/leftovers/garbage. You have to feed the rat in order for it to be well fed and strong, but throughout the journey it will come across obstacles, such as rat traps! Or even other mean rats! </p1>

<p2> I would like the option to name the rat. And perhaps choose levels of difficulty - like lanky rat (easy mode) vs. big boy rat (hard mode). Throughout the journey maybe it could make friends with other rats and you'd find food together more easy. This is a pretty simple concept, but I'm hoping to add fun side adventures or obstacles to make it more interesting!</p2>
