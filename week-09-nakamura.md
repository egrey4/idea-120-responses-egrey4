<h1> Digitizing Race Response </h1>

<p1> This weeks reading was a challenging one, but very eye-opening to the ways that the internet existed in its earlier days.
  And I've never really considered how much this has changed over time. 
  The interenet was definitely a biased design, that lead to exclusion and lack of accessibilty.
  It was essentially a luxury service that catered towards wealthy people - mainly white folks.
  Although this gap has changed, there are still divides and lack of accessibility. 
  I also learned about the term "color-blind" and how choosing to not see race is indeed still racism. </p1>
  
  <p2> Lev Manovich says "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure", which I think is very true because technology is so heavily related to our identity. 
  For example, TikTok and its "for you page". This identifies with our mental structure because the algorithm is based upon our interests and likes, and creates a personal stream of videos that we will enjoy.
  The developers make these pre-planned/programmed stream of videos based on our viewing history, likes, and who we follow. This structure is so addictive, and they created it to be that way in order for us to continue using it.
  Similarly, Instagram reels and the homepage utilize a similar scheme, by using our history and interests. This is why social media is so addictive - because they know us so well!</p2>
