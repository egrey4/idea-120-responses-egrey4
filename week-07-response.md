<h1> Something Is Wrong On The Internet </h1> 

<p1> This weeks reading was quite interesting, as I've been thinking about how many children I've seen in public watching this strange "kid friendly" content.
  From Bridles reading, he talked about "Kids Youtube", which to me is genuinely frightening - especially since this content is so popular. 
  I agree that this category of content is a problem, since small children seem to be mesmerised by these videos as if they are getting hypnotized. 
  Bridle mentions specific tactics that these creators use in order to lure their audience, which is also very scary since they can easily alter these for malicious or harmful intent.
I also agree with how he feels that this content feels dark and distrubing. I understand that it is marketed towards children, but the fact that some of these videos are created by bots is so strange and might not even be safe. Also the content and titles are creepy, and feel troll-y and sumbliminal-message-y, and exploit these children that don't know any better.</p1> 

<p2> As for Bridles solution to this, I think videos like this will always continue to thrive, given the fact that so many kids are given ipads, or have easy internet access. I think it's a matter of understanding the system and how "the system is complicit in abuse". The only fair answer to this is not allowing your child to view this content or watching over their screens. Because this is content created for the sole purpose of money, I don't think it'll just go away. This kind of infrastructural violence being done is scary, the only thing to do is be responsible and understand that content can be damaging. </p2>
