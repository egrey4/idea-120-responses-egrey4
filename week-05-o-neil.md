## Weapons of Math Destruction In Our Prison System

In Cathy O'Neil's reading, she explains the mathmatical models called WMDs or "Weapons of Math Destructions" used in Big Data companies and software systems. 
These models are harmful because they are based upon bias, assumptions, and unfair algorithms, which ultimately lets the machine do the talking. 
These models create a "feedback loop" that produce an ongoing and unfair social pattern. 
Because of this, WMD's negatively impact the root of our social system, which punish the poor, create injustice, and target unprivileged people. 

One example of an WMD is used in our court system and is based on recidivism. 
A popular model used is called an LSI-R, or "Level of Service Inventory-Revised". 
This is a long questionnaire that a offenders fills out, and it determines their level of risk to society and whether or not they will be sentenced to prison or death penalty. 
This computerized system asks extremely predjudicial questions that target unprivileged people of color. 
Some questions ask about the first time ever involved with the police, any prior convictions, whether their friends and relatives have criminal records, etc.
The answers are then put into a point system, but questions about recidivism count for more points, and they are then put into high, medium, and low risk categories. 

The LSI-R system is extremely unjust, and preys on people of color.
Instead of focusing on the actual case and crime itself, it brings in topics on the offenders upbringing and family, which are details that spark assumptions and bias.
Many unprivileged people in black and Latino communities are in stuck in this toxic cycle because of our unfair system.
The use of the LSI-R exacerbates this issue.
Instead of being questioned on the offense, they are judged by who they are - and in turn this statistical system sustains the WMD feedback loop.
