<h1> Portfolio Proposal </h1> 

<p1> For my portfolio, I would like to have a fairly simple and straightforward layout. I would have my name on the top left and below is a menu bar that lists an about me page, IDEA 120 - which then leads to markdowns for each individual project. I'd also like another list for my sculpture class that has photos of my work and maybe short blurb describing them. And additionally I'd really like to add another list for my personal ceramic works with photos and short descriptions. </p1>
