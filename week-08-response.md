<h1> Week 8 Response </h1>

<p1> From our reading "Online Advertising", I learned about how much personalized advertising effects its users and also targets specifc groups of people when consuming media on the internet.
As an avid internet user, it's frightening to see how much accurate information it collects to curate specific ads. 
It's unfortunate how companies take advantage of our data for their benefit. And it angers me how they target inequality in order to schemingly fraud people's pain points.</p1>

<p2> One method of personal advertizements that O'Neil discusses is called the "Bayesian Approach". This is when our data variables are ranked in order to produce their desired income. Platforms like Google and Facebook utilize thus model because it allows advertisers to segment their target populations in meticulous detail. For example, through search advertising, billboards, and TV. Another method is A/B testing, where if one thing doesn't reel you in, they'll try another method. For example, by ignoring a credit card offer in the mail, you are participating in this test, and they'll find another way to lure you. And also, machine learning AI that measure our internet patterns and creates relevant outcomes. </p2> 

<p3> I still feel stuck in the middle as to whether the internet would be more useful and egalitarian without these methods. I do find it frustrating and sad when companies target vulnerable groups, because they are giving empty promises and scheming their pain points. But I also can find an appreciation for targeted ads, because its interesting and in some cases helpful at how accurate these curations are. I think I would fully be able to support targeted ads if there was a way for them to not be malicious. </p3>
