In our reading, Janet Murray gives an explaination on her view for the future of digital TV and the cyberdrama formats. 
Many of her predictions aren't exactly accurate, thugh they are comparable to our advancing technologies. 
She explains how TV will connect with the internet in a digital hyperserial narrative, where viewers immerse themselves into the virtual set design/artifacts where the viewers truly plays the story. Unfortnately we haven't gotten to that point in digital TV media yet, but VR is comparable when playing video games. 
She also mentions how we will have cyberdramas that address socially charged issues like racism and abortion, where the audience can converse in chatrooms configured as sites in the universe of the program. I think this idea of virtual conncection and engagement is amazing, but sadly not true - perhaps it is similar to the Reddit platform which provokes discussion topics and chatting. 
Also, her vision for hyper-rrealistic 3D environments as she describes as "dreamscapes" isn't exactly accurate, but again is still comparable to virtual reality video games. 


Murrays predictions compare to the hyper-realistic virtual environments the actors of 'The Mandalorian' because they utilize virtual sets. Using virtual screens allows for a scarily realistic setting post-production. Which is helpful in saving money on traveling, building new sets, etc. 
When filming, the actor is surrounded by LED screens and a few props in order to for the actor to have a more realistic feel in the space. And viewers are able to enjoy a hyper-realistic movie. This advancement of production is still growing, but has changed the history of film!
