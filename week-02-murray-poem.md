In this weeks reading, I learned how technology advanced a *tremendous* amount!
All the way back in the late 1800's, there was the invention of the camera, which led to film and photoplays.
This was a paradigm shift for them, which piloted the digital environment of **cyberspace**!!!
Early users started to feel a connection to this digital world with programs like ELIZA and multiplayer games like Zork.
Now, technology is an integral part of how we function on a day to day basis. The internet continues to be an evergrowing and complex network that we use for leisure, communication, work, and more!
