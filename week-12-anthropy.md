<h1> Anna Anthropy Response </h1> 

<p1> This weeks reading was an insightful piece as someone that never had an interest in conventional video games. This is still such an important topic to understand the history of. I think a big part of why I never had an interest in video games relates to Anna's point about the "target demographic" of earlier video games, and as a woman, I don't fit this model. While I do appreciate video games, a big reason why I personally have never gotten into it was because it is an activity highly dominated by men, and because of this I felt weird about it. Though I think this may have changed though if I saw more representation of women playing games growing up. And representation is such a significant piece to improving it. </p1> 

<p2>In order for video games to improve, there needs to be easier accessibility for gaming and coding. Anna mentions how early video game developers fit a certain mold. They were typically affluent and educated white men that had accessibility and resources to code. And because of this, these creators developed video games for their same demographic - men. I do think that this issue has been improving over the last decade, since there are programs for women that code and it is more common for women to play video games. This is a great step for improving representation in video games. Anna said that it's "terrifying that an entire art form can be dominated by a single perspective". This is why it's so important to open up gaming and coding to diverse groups of people, and that's when the change will take place. </p2>
  
<p3>Opening up the demographic to other groups like women, LGTBQ+ communities, etc. will also help this issue. This starts with creating games that shows their representation. As Anna mentions, big budget video games follow this dangerous cycle, where publishers and shareholders aim to create what sells - action and shooting games designed for men. The exclusion of stories of certain audiences is dangerous because it establishes a model that lacks diversity. Opening up accesible game creation tools to many audiences will allow for wider set of experiences and present a wider range of perspective.</p3>
  
<p4>The transformation of video game topics and disregarding the typical demographic is important because everyone deserves to be represented. Video games should be seen as an art form that anyone can create and reach. It's great that nowadays there are means that allow more than just your typical programmers and big game publishers to create games. And as this continues to grow and reach wider audiences, there are more interesting and abstract video games you can play! </p4>
