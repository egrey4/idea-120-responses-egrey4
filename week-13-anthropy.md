<h1> Anna Anthropy Questions and Response  </h1> 

<p1> While reading these chapters, one question in particular that I will discuss is - how are digital games comparable to "real-life" games? 
  In chapter 3, Anna talked about what makes a game a game. She says that a game is a series of interactions between the player and rules. Specifically, a game can be anything that explores dynamics, relationships, and systems.
  She then discussed the simple and straightforward game of IT. This is what made me question whether digital games are comparable to real-life games like IT vs. a digital game like Tetris. They both share a relationship of rules and players but the only difference is that one is tangible.</p1>


<p2> I'm curious whether a physical game is better than a digital game. Personally, I think physical games are more suited for younger kids because most of them are pretty straightforward. Games like duck duck goose, freeze dance, or scavenger hunting aren't too detailed and are readily available to play. Although there are online games made for kids that I remember using, such as coolmathgames.com. These educational games were both easy to understand and entertaining. </p2> 

<p3> Though, I do think an upside to digital games is that the possibilities are endless. Nowadays you can really make anything into a game and it can be as simple or as detailed and difficult as the creator wants. Now that there are online platforms that allow game development and that people are learning to code their own games, it's becoming a lot more accessible. But I also think it's interesting that physical games are brought into the digital world, such as playing chess online with a friend. Overall, while I do love the nostalgia and feeling of playing physical games, I think its clear that digital games dominate them because of the wide range of variety and possibilities they bring to the user! </p3>
