When considering an "internet meme", I think it would be interpretted differently if it was in the medium of the radio. 
So, instead of having both the visual cue of the image and text, it would just be the meme's linguistic text in audio form. 
According to Barthes, a meme has a "linguistic" message because of the textual information, a "literal" message based on the image, and a "symbolic" message because of way that the viewer interprets the meme.
If a meme was in the medium of a radio, all that would be presented is the textual information in audio form. 
This would change the meaning completely because it lacks the literal context of the image. And because of this, the message would be constrewed and nonsensical. 
The listener wouldn't have that visual cue to connect back to, which is the overall purpose of a meme. 
It also depends on the audience. Some people have a better understanding of memes, and they already have that denoted connection in their mind. 
I think of a meme as both a cold and hot medium since there is some effort of engagement when reading and finding the connection/meaning. 
So it would be interesting to see a meme in radio form, because its considered a hot medium where theres little engagement.
